Makefile is used for compilation

Hence for testing the codes, insert the following command lines in linux/UNIX terminal (ignoring the numbers):

1. make

2. ./sim

Or simply include the functions to the main function

<Cleaning the output files>

For re-compilation do the following in the linux/UNIX terminal:

1. make clean
2. make


<Function dependencies>

implicit_euler.c, implicit_euler.h, helper.c, and helper.h must all be used
